<h1 id="yasne">Elliot</h1>
          <p id="ysne">Elliot Alderson is a former cybersecurity engineer of Allsafe Cybersecurity and a member of fsociety. He is played by
          Rami Malek.
          
          Elliot suffers from social anxiety disorder, clinical depression, delusions and paranoia. His internal life is revealed
          via voice-overs that provide insight into his mental state, his opinions of the people he encounters and the activity
          around him. These dialogues with the audience are designed to help us interpret Elliot's world, but given his mental
          illness,
          <p> he is an unreliable narrator, leaving us unsure whether what he tells us we're seeing is actually what is
          happening. Typical of this is when Elliot hears everyone around him refer to E Corp as Evil Corp, reflecting his own
          opinion of the conglomerate.</p>
